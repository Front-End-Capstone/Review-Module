            Amazing walk up Hollywood Hill with beautiful views upon the city.
            The guide Leopold seems to know pretty much everything about the
            city, itâ€™s super entertaining listening to all the small (Website
            hidden by Airbnb) and stories he has to tell. Great start to any LA
            vacation!
